# keyshare.link

this is the source code for https://keyshare.link

I have created this site to give people a more realistic chance of getting a key without the fear of a "bot" claiming it

and also give the submitter a better understanding that a legitimate user will actually claim the key

I have included the source for the site so people can look over it or host it themselves.

features of the site are:

* restriction of claimant for minimum link karma
* restriction of claimant for minimum comment karma
* restriction of claimant for minimum account age
* hCaptcha to prevent bots from scraping
* reveals the key to public are 30 minutes to prevent resellers hold on to the key.
* claiming the key will bind to your account
* submitter of key is able to see who claimed the key
* rate limited claiming of 1 key per 5 minutes to give a fair chance to people claiming
